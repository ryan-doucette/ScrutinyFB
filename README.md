ScrutinyFB CS3200 Database Design Project


<h3> A general description of the data domain of the project. As well as the capabilities the project will provide. </h3>
  <p align='center'>
This project is tailored towards the domain of fantasy football. Fantasy football is a game in which multiple players play in a league, head to head games are then played within that league each week. Points are accumulated by stats which NFL football players rack up in real life. Our purpose of this assignment is to provide a platform for people to easily access relationships and patterns that these statistics follow. This project will allow people to analyze players and their trends when playing against certain teams, in certain conditions such as playing on the home or away, down to details which are very difficult to deduct by just looking at stat sheets, such as how weight of running backs (a statistic crucial to this position) impacts how they play against a certain defense. In a type of entertainment which has really picked up in the last two years, this is a tool which many fantasy players are missing. To be able to do your own fantasy analysis is something which requires painstaking scraping through spreadsheets of data which often feels jumbled. Our project would allow for the spreadsheets of data to be hidden behind a pretty front end which allows for much quicker and simpler analysis in the domain of fantasy football.
